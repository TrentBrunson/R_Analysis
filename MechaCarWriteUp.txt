provide a small writeup of your interpretation of the multiple linear regression results. Be sure to include the following details:
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?



provide a short write-up of your interpretation and findings for the suspension coil summary statistics. Be sure to include the following details:
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance 
of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch. 
Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification? 
Why or why not?

data:  Suspension_Coil_Table$PSI
t = -0.65784, df = 149, p-value = 0.5117
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1500
95 percent confidence interval:
 1498.122 1500.940
sample estimates:
mean of x 
 1499.531


Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar outperforms the competition. In your study design, be sure to write about the following considerations:

Think critically about what metrics you would think would be of interest to a consumer (cost, fuel efficiency, color options, etc.).
Determine what question we would ask, what the null and alternative hypothesis would be to answer that question, and what statistical test could be used to test this hypothesis.
Knowing what test should be used, what data should be collected?
